Vexing Parse:



The vexing parse in C++ is an ambiguity where code that looks like it should create an object is mistakenly interpreted by the compiler as a function declaration instead. This can lead to confusing and unintended behavior.
Example:

cpp code:
MyClass obj(MyOtherClass());

This looks like it should create an obj of type MyClass, but the compiler sees it as a declaration of a function obj that takes a function returning MyOtherClass as an argument and returns a MyClass.
How to Avoid:

    Use brace initialization: MyClass obj{MyOtherClass()};
    Add extra parentheses: MyClass obj((MyOtherClass()));

Summary:

The vexing parse is a tricky C++ syntax issue where object initialization can be misinterpreted as a function declaration.

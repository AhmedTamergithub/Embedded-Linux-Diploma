Name Mangling: C++ uses name mangling to support function overloading, whereas C does not. This means that C++ functions and variables have unique names based on their signature, while C uses plain names. To import C functions or classes into C++, you may need to use extern "C" to prevent name mangling.



example: 

extern "C" {
    #include "legacy_c_code.h"
}

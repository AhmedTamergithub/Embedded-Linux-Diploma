If you use the lower_bound function with a value that is less than all the elements in the sorted container, the iterator returned will point to the first element in the container. This is because lower_bound returns an iterator to the first element that is not less than the given value.
Example:

Consider the sorted array:

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> v = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

    int value = 5;  // Value less than all elements in the vector
    auto it = std::lower_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), value);

    if (it != v.end()) {
        std::cout << "The iterator points to: " << *it << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "The value is greater than all elements." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

Output:

vbnet

The iterator points to: 10

Explanation:

    Since 5 is less than all the elements in the array {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, std::lower_bound will return an iterator pointing to the first element (10).
    This behavior makes lower_bound useful for determining insertion points in sorted containers, even if the value is smaller than all elements.

In short, if the value is less than all elements in the array, lower_bound returns an iterator to the first element of the array.

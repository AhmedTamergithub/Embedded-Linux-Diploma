A const lvalue reference in C++ can bind to an rvalue (a temporary value), which is a special exception in the language. Here's a brief explanation:
Key Points

    Binding to Rvalues:
        Normally, lvalue references require an lvalue (a value with a specific memory location) to bind to.
        However, a const lvalue reference can also bind to an rvalue (a temporary value), like a literal or the result of an expression.
        Example:

        cpp

        const int &ref = 10;  // `ref` binds to the temporary rvalue `10`

    Lifetime Extension:
        When an rvalue is bound to a const lvalue reference, the lifetime of that rvalue is extended to match the lifetime of the reference.
        This makes it safe to use the temporary value throughout the scope of the reference.

    Read-Only Access:
        Since the reference is const, the rvalue cannot be modified through the reference.
        This ensures the immutability of the temporary value, which aligns with its transient nature.

Summary

A const lvalue reference can bind to an rvalue, allowing you to safely reference a temporary value without copying it. The reference provides read-only access, and the lifetime of the rvalue is extended to match that of the reference.

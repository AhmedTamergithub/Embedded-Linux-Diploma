In C++ polymorphism, a virtual table (vtable) is a mechanism used to support dynamic (or runtime) polymorphism, especially in the context of inheritance.
Key Concepts:

    Virtual Table (vtable):
        The vtable is a table of function pointers. Each class that uses virtual functions has its own vtable.
        The vtable contains pointers to the virtual functions that the class can call.

    Virtual Function:
        When a class has a virtual function, the compiler creates a vtable for that class.
        Each object of the class (or derived class) holds a pointer to its class's vtable, known as the vptr.

    How It Works:
        When a virtual function is called on an object, the compiler uses the object's vptr to look up the correct function in the vtable.
        This allows the program to determine at runtime which function to invoke, enabling polymorphism.

    Polymorphism:
        The virtual table allows a base class pointer to call the derived class's overridden function, even though the call was made through the base class interface. This is the essence of runtime polymorphism.

Summary:

The virtual table is a crucial component in C++ that facilitates dynamic polymorphism by mapping function calls to the appropriate overridden functions in derived classes at runtime.

Here's a brief explanation of the difference between pointers and iterators:

    Pointers:
        Definition: A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
        Usage: Primarily used to directly access memory locations and perform pointer arithmetic.
        Flexibility: Can point to any type of data, not limited to specific containers.
        Example: int* ptr = &var; allows direct access to the memory address of var.

    Iterators:
        Definition: An iterator is an abstract object that provides a way to traverse elements in an STL container (like std::vector, std::list).
        Usage: Used to iterate over containers in a type-safe and container-specific way.
        Flexibility: Designed for use with specific container types, offering a consistent interface for traversal.
        Example: std::vector<int>::iterator it = vec.begin(); allows access to the elements of vec.

Summary:

    Pointer: Direct memory access and manipulation.
    Iterator: Abstract, container-specific element traversal.

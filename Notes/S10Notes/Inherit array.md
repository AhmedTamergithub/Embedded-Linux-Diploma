When you declare a class that inherits from std::array, you're essentially creating a new class that extends the functionality of the std::array container. This new class will inherit all the member functions and properties of std::array and can also have additional methods or member variables specific to your derived class.
Basic Concept:

    Inheritance: In C++, inheritance allows a class to acquire the properties (data members and member functions) of another class. When a class inherits from std::array, it can directly access the array functionalities like begin(), end(), size(), etc., and you can add more functionalities if needed.

    std::array: This is a standard library container that represents a fixed-size array. It provides various functions for manipulating the array elements (like iterators, access methods, etc.).

Example:

Let's create a class that inherits from std::array:

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <array>

template <typename T, std::size_t N>
class MyArray : public std::array<T, N> {
public:
    // Additional method to print all elements of the array
    void print() const {
        for (const auto& elem : *this) {
            std::cout << elem << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }

    // You can add more custom methods or override existing ones if necessary
};

int main() {
    MyArray<int, 5> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Use inherited methods from std::array
    std::cout << "Size of array: " << arr.size() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "First element: " << arr.front() << std::endl;

    // Use custom method from MyArray
    std::cout << "Array elements: ";
    arr.print();

    return 0;
}

Explanation:

    Inheritance:
        MyArray is a template class that inherits from std::array<T, N>, where T is the type of the elements, and N is the size of the array.
        This means MyArray can use all the functions provided by std::array like size(), front(), begin(), and so on.

    Custom Methods:
        In the MyArray class, we've added a print() method that iterates over the array and prints all its elements.
        The keyword this refers to the current object, and *this is used to access the array's elements directly.

    Usage:
        When you create an instance of MyArray, it behaves like an std::array but with additional capabilities, like the print() method we added.

When to Use:

    Inheriting from std::array might be useful when you want to add specific behaviors to an array while retaining all the functionalities of std::array.
    However, be cautious with inheritance from standard containers like std::array, as it might not always be the best design choice. In many cases, it's better to prefer composition (e.g., having std::array as a member of your class) over inheritance.

Summary:

    Inheriting from std::array: Creates a class that retains all the functionalities of std::array and allows you to extend it with custom behaviors.
    Usage: This approach is useful when you want to combine the power of std::array with additional methods or properties specific to your problem domain.

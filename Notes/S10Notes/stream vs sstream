In C++, std::string and std::stringstream are both used for handling strings, but they serve different purposes and have different functionalities.
std::string

    Purpose:
        std::string is a class in the C++ Standard Library that represents and manages sequences of characters (strings).

    Common Operations:
        Creation: You can create and manipulate strings easily.

        cpp

std::string myString = "Hello, World!";

Concatenation: Strings can be concatenated using the + operator.

cpp

std::string greeting = "Hello, " + myString;

Access: You can access individual characters using the [] operator or methods like .at().

cpp

char firstChar = myString[0]; // 'H'

Finding and Substrings: You can find substrings, check the length, etc.

cpp

        size_t pos = myString.find("World");
        std::string sub = myString.substr(0, 5); // "Hello"

    Usage:
        std::string is typically used when you need to store, modify, or manipulate strings of text.

std::stringstream

    Purpose:
        std::stringstream is a class in the C++ Standard Library that allows you to work with strings in a way similar to how you would work with input/output streams (std::cin and std::cout). Itâ€™s part of the sstream library and is used for both input and output operations on strings.

    Common Operations:
        Input Operations (extraction): You can extract data from a string, similar to how you read from a stream.

        cpp

std::string data = "123 456 789";
std::stringstream ss(data);
int a, b, c;
ss >> a >> b >> c;
// a = 123, b = 456, c = 789

Output Operations (insertion): You can build a string by inserting data into the stream.

cpp

        std::stringstream ss;
        ss << "Hello, " << "World!" << 123;
        std::string result = ss.str(); // "Hello, World!123"

    Usage:
        std::stringstream is typically used when you need to perform formatted input/output operations on strings, such as converting between strings and other data types, constructing strings dynamically, or parsing strings into multiple values.

Key Differences

    Functionality:
        std::string: Primarily used for storing and manipulating sequences of characters.
        std::stringstream: Used for performing input/output operations on strings, similar to how you would use std::cin or std::cout.

    Operations:
        std::string: Supports direct string operations like concatenation, searching, and substrings.
        std::stringstream: Allows you to extract and insert data into/from a string as if you were working with a stream.

    Use Cases:
        std::string: When you simply need to store or manipulate a string.
        std::stringstream: When you need to convert between strings and other types, or when you need to build a string from various data types in a formatted way.

Conclusion

    Use std::string for general-purpose string storage and manipulation.
    Use std::stringstream when you need stream-like behavior for strings, such as parsing a string or dynamically constructing a string with mixed types.

MAIN USAGE: NO NEED FOR SIZING THE CONTAINER MANUALLY









std::back_inserter is a function in C++ that creates a special iterator, called a back-insert iterator, which allows elements to be added to the back (or end) of a container like a vector, list, or deque. It is part of the <iterator> header. When you use std::back_inserter, it calls the container's push_back method to append elements, instead of overwriting them like a normal iterator would.
Example Usage:

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iterator>  // Required for std::back_inserter

int main() {
    std::vector<int> source = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::vector<int> destination;

    // Copying elements from source to destination using std::back_inserter
    std::copy(source.begin(), source.end(), std::back_inserter(destination));

    // Display the copied elements
    for (int num : destination) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}

Output:

1 2 3 4 5

In this example, std::back_inserter(destination) creates an iterator that appends elements to destination using push_back. This is especially useful when you want to avoid resizing the container manually or overwriting existing elements.

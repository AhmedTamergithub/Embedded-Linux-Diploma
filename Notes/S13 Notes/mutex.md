A mutex (short for "mutual exclusion") is a synchronization primitive used in concurrent programming to ensure that only one thread or process can access a resource at a time. It is a crucial tool for managing shared resources and preventing race conditions in multi-threaded applications.
Key Points About Mutex:

    Purpose:
        The primary purpose of a mutex is to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads, which could lead to inconsistent or corrupted data.

    Basic Operation:
        Lock: When a thread wants to access a shared resource, it must first lock the mutex. If the mutex is already locked by another thread, the requesting thread will be blocked until the mutex becomes available.
        Unlock: After the thread finishes accessing the shared resource, it must unlock the mutex to allow other threads to access it.
        Usage Example in C++: The C++ Standard Library provides the std::mutex class in the <mutex> header for basic mutual exclusion.

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

std::mutex mtx;  // Mutex object

void print_even(int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i += 2) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);  // Lock the mutex
        std::cout << "Even: " << i << std::endl;
        // Mutex is automatically released when lock goes out of scope
    }
}

void print_odd(int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 2) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);  // Lock the mutex
        std::cout << "Odd: " << i << std::endl;
        // Mutex is automatically released when lock goes out of scope
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(print_even, 10);
    std::thread t2(print_odd, 10);

    t1.join();  // Wait for t1 to finish
    t2.join();  // Wait for t2 to finish

    return 0;
}

In this example:

    std::mutex mtx; declares a mutex.
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx); locks the mutex when a thread enters the critical section and automatically unlocks it when the lock object goes out of scope.

Benefits:

    Prevents Race Conditions: Ensures that only one thread can modify shared data at a time, preventing inconsistent results.
    Simplifies Synchronization: Provides a straightforward mechanism for thread synchronization and resource management.

Drawbacks:

    Potential for Deadlocks: If not used carefully, multiple threads could end up waiting indefinitely for each other to release mutexes, causing a deadlock.
    Performance Overhead: Mutexes can introduce performance overhead due to the locking and unlocking operations, especially in highly concurrent systems.

Pointers and Defaulted Constructors:

    If you're using the = default; keyword to instruct the compiler to generate a default constructor, the compiler will not automatically manage pointers (e.g., it won’t allocate or deallocate memory for pointers).
    The pointer members in the class will remain uninitialized unless explicitly initialized in the member initializer list or within the constructor.

Example:

cpp

class MyClass {
private:
    int* ptr;

public:
    // Default constructor using = default
    MyClass() = default;  // Pointer ptr remains uninitialized (could be a dangling pointer)

    // If you need to manage the pointer, you'd need to write the constructor yourself
    MyClass() : ptr(new int(42)) {}  // Initialize the pointer
};

3. When Not to Use Pointers in Default Constructors:

    Uninitialized Pointers: If a pointer is not initialized in a default constructor, it could lead to undefined behavior if it’s later dereferenced without being assigned a valid memory address.
    Memory Management: If you dynamically allocate memory in a default constructor, you must ensure proper deallocation (e.g., in a destructor) to avoid memory leaks.

Summary:

Pointers can be used in default constructors, but it's essential to initialize them appropriately to avoid issues like undefined behavior or memory leaks. When using the = default; keyword, the compiler doesn't handle pointer initialization, so you must manage pointers explicitly.
